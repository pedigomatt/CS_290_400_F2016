    <h1>Watson AlchemyData News API How To - Matt Pedigo CS290 Web Development</h1>
    <p>This Guide will walk you through the steps and share point out specific points to use the API to filter for desired news stories.</p>
    <p>AlchemyData News indexes over 250k english news sites every day making the information available for AI scanning. Historical searches can be done back 60days.</p>
    <p>This guide will skip over the obvious stuff about setting up the API key. The directions for this are fairly obvious,so they will only be mentioned at the beginning.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The first step to getting the AlchemyData News API setup and running is to setup a bluelink account and request an API key.The api should look like this:</li>
          <br>
          <div> apikey=070a842a6857de9da66f740d96c636039316fc26 </div>
          <br>

          <li>The next step is to review the details of the get request. Currently, this API only allows get request but soon it will allow push requests as well.
              <br>There are several parts to the API request that tells the application what type of news articles you are looking for and what values you want back in response.
              <br>The AlchemyData News uses a rest API and the following lists out the components to the API request.
              <br>These different parts are strung together with an '&' symbol.  </li>
